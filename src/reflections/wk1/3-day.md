## Day 3

### Learning Bootstrap

After catching up on flex box and grids, we dived into Bootstrap and learned about it's row and column structure.
Built-in Bootstrap functions will help a lot to quickly build and style html without investing too much time in CSS.
After cloning many sites, I feel semi-confident with my bootstrap abilities.

1. Space things out, change colors and tinker until it looks satisfying to look at. Keep tinkering until you're proud of it and if that fails, look at other websites and put your own spin on their style.

2. Netflix's design has always been incredibly simple while still being satisfying to scroll through. The end design of a website usually has to do more with what is on the website, rather than what you want to do with it. A forum website can't have the same design as Netflix's as it is a television streaming website, and has no forums.

3. Good, satisfying design can help draw people in and get them spending more time looking at your website and advertisements. Bad website design can create suspicion around the security of the website and can cause people to lose trust in your services.
