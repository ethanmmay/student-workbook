## Day 3

### Learning Bootstrap

After catching up on flex box and grids, we dived into Bootstrap and learned about it's row and column structure.
Built-in Bootstrap functions will help a lot to quickly build and style html without investing too much time in CSS.
After cloning many sites, I feel semi-confident with my bootstrap abilities.
