## Day 5

### Working on Checkpoint 1

After a short lecture about our goals for our Checkpoint, I got to work and finished all requirements in Checkpoint 1. I plan to take an attempt at the stretch goals over the weekend. I feel confident in my Bootstrap, HTML and CSS skills and am excited to move on to Javascript.
