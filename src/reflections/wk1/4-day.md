## Day 4

### Wire-framing & Planning

Starting the day off with learning about CSS Grids, we moved onto basic web design principles using a site called Figma to prototype the design for websites.
During Lab, we (George Condit and I) worked on our clone of the Den of Geek webpage. We finished the basic areas of the website but still need to style everything.

#### 1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?

```Wire-framing helps create a plan and save time, accelerating agile web development in order to simplify the development process.```

#### 2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

```Websites that offer a larger variety of services require more detail in their website design, and therefore require a more detailed wireframe as well.```

#### 3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

```Yes, because they have the potential to save you from wasting a lot of Time, Energy and Effort down the line. Spending time tinkering with Design mid-development on a tight deadline is dangerous.```
