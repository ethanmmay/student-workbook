## Day 4

### Wire-framing & Planning

Starting the day off with learning about CSS Grids, we moved onto basic web design principles using a site called Figma to prototype the design for websites.
During Lab, we (George Condit and I) worked on our clone of the Den of Geek webpage. We finished the basic areas of the website but still need to style everything.

1. Wire-framing helps create a plan and save time, accelerating agile web development in order to simplify the development process.

2. Websites that offer a larger variety of services require more detail in their website design, and therefore require a more detailed wireframe as well.

3. Yes, because they have the potential to save you from wasting a lot of Time, Energy and Effort down the line. Spending time tinkering with Design mid-development on a tight deadline is dangerous.
