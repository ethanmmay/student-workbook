## Day 4

Starting the day off with learning about CSS Grids, we moved onto basic web design principles using a site called Figma to prototype the design for websites.
During Lab, we (George Condit and I) worked on our clone of the Den of Geek webpage. We finished the basic areas of the website but still need to style everything.
