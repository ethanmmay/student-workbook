1. A pseudo-class is a class with properties that are more specific than the general class of the element. For example, a :hover class has specific properties for when you hover over the element with the class.

2. Specificity 

3. When everyone has absolute power, nobody does. !important is a useful, last-case tool that helps overwrite the properties of non-important classes.
