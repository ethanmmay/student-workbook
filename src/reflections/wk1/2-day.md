## Day 2

### HTML/CSS Overview & More Introduction

Through the power of remote working, I learned about flex boxes, the connectivity of HTML and CSS and more properties of the web page.

#### 1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

```A pseudo-class is a class with properties that are more specific than the general class of the element. For example, a :hover class has specific properties for when you hover over the element with the class.```

#### 2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

```Specificity is how CSS decides what properties will overwrite others and can be manipulated by understanding how CSS uses a cascading order of operations to decide this. You can use !important or change when your desired property is called to manipulate specificity.```

#### 3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

```When everyone has absolute power, nobody does. !important is a useful, last-case tool that helps overwrite the properties of non-important classes.```
