## Day 1

### Introduction & Environment Set-up

After being introduced to the course, we went in-depth on how to set up the environment and tools of a Full Stack developer.
Using VSC, Git and specialized CodeWorks tools, we have a testing environment set up to see concrete changes in our pages.

1. We use Git to manage versions of our code to keep backups, distribute code and even create multiple versions (branches) of the code.

2. You can use multiple branches to have two people work on two parts of the code at the same time. You can then merge these changes together later. This vastly increases productivity.

3. GitHub is where you can view your code and other's with Graphical User Interfaces and even create profiles in a Social Media fashion. Git is the specialized part of GitHub that manages version control and it's conflicts and changes.
