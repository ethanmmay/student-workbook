## Day 1

### Grading & Kanban Introduction

Today being our first day as the "senior class", we rewarded ourself with starting an hour later. Then we graded Checkpoint 5 and I felt really proud of what I made. While it didn't have a special theme, it was still well built, bugless (that I know of) and elegantly programmed. There were of course many stretch goals I could have accomplished but I figured I would save my energy for the next two checkpoints which are also in quick succession of each other. After grading we started Kanban which is basically a Trello clone. I set up back-end for the Boards and Lists, and started building out a Vue frontend.

1. Pair programming involves one driver and one navigator. The driver builds muscle memory by doing the physical work of typing and the navigator devises the logic and communicates it to the driver.

2. Pair programming partly removes the dependency on intellisense. It also forces the navigator to think logically about each small problem and think of a solution instead of brute-force testing code until it returns somewhat desired results.

3. Pair programming causes two people to work as efficiently as one and puts a lot of pressure on the navigator to come up with solutions as the driver waits. The driver may get a few opportunities to think about the logic and what they want to do, but has to resist the temptation to implement it and wait for the navigator.
