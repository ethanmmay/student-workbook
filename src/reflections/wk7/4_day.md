## Day 4

### High Productivity & Deadline Stress

With the first day of having absolutely no lecture, we (Aaron Gorder and I) kicked it into high gear and pumped out the features to satisfy the requirements of the kanban checkpoint. After lots of segway features, I encountered a front-end logic problem on how to move tasks on a list to another. I noticed my peers doing a less UI-Simple but easy to complete version of this feature, and my team and I decided to do ours differently. While it was more difficult to understand, it helped me improve my knowledge and understanding of the data in my application and how to use it to create new features.

#### 1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

```We occasionally used pair programming to re-center ourselves on problems, we slightly used code documentation on our most complex code for our future selves to understand it, and finally, we thought about user stories and UI/UX design and how we could implement it's simplest ideas.```

#### 2. What went well?

```Our feature sprints worked well and had little to none long bug-fixing sessions. This is probably due to these features being used in the majority of our previous projects.```

#### 3. What would you do differently?

```I would focus on keeping all of the features for each nested object organized. I extended functionality to children models too quickly and it created a lot of back-end errors that I had to go back and fix each time I expected it to work first time.```
