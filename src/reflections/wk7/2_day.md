## Day 2

### Postman Testing & Building Kanban

With a short lecture on using Postman to test our backend, Aaron and I went over our Kanban project and I explained some things I set up in his absence from the day before. As we moved through the project, we developed both of our understanding of the app and how router components accept props and how router links can transfer data between pages. We continued to work on our 6th checkpoint until the end of the day.

#### 1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

```Code documentation is a summarized, in-english portion of the project that explains the what, how, why and where of variables, functions and features. You can document code with notes using line comments, add a readme to explain the overall code, add markdown or text files that explain more specific parts of the code or have a webpage that explains how your api works and where the data is located.```

#### 2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

```Code documentation can help the original programmer's understanding of the code as well as any visitors or other programmers who need to understand the code. It increases the overall accessibility and decreases the amount of time it takes to learn the code.```

#### 3. How important is Code documentation and why?

```Code documentation is extremely important to the lifespan of the code. Without concise, readable documentation, a codebase is much less likely to survive as it takes programmers longer to understand and integrate that code into their own.```
