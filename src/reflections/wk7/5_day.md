## Day 5

### Career Services and Starting a Bug Log

Starting the day off with a presentation from Brittany on how to use LinkedIn to your advantage, we moved into our final day of week seven by starting a project that requires us to use postman testing to ensure our back-end's functionality. I toiled away for a few hours figuring out my backend and had a few problems passing the postman tests, but eventually figured out the entire backend and passed all Postman tests by the end of the day. Later that night I worked on creating the first page and the means to get to the next. Working with Postman testing gave much more concrete rules on what code can pass and what can't and helped me understand how a working environment would measure your development progress. Overall week 7 was a project-filled one and I hope to be able to stay on top of all of these projects as well as working on my own marketability on LinkedIn and GitHub.
