## Day 3

### More Checkpoint Work

With our first lecture from Jake, we learned more about best practices with Vue and how to validate Server data. Then we moved back to our project and worked on styling, adding more content and making sure the right content displays.

1. A user experience is how an average person would make their way through a website. Primary areas of interest should be considered when making a User Experience because they are the most likely areas where users will click first. 

2. If a front-end designer does not take into account simplicity and the user experience, they will not have that in mind when choosing placement for buttons, images and text. The user will not know where to look or what to click and will feel frustrated that the website wasn't made with common sense.

3.  The user experience is so important because it's the emergent storyline of how a user will interact and what level of pleasure each section of the site will provide. If it's simple, common sense and easy to navigate, the user will either not notice it, or be happy with how simple it was to find what they wanted. If it was difficult to navigate, the user will most definitely be annoyed or even angry about the lack of consideration of the user experience.
