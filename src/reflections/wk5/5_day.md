## Day 5

### Hackathon

Kicking off a long day with a kahoot to gauge our current confidence levels, my team (Alex Foster and Geo Condit) and I started working on our Social Forums site named Spectre Social. We planned it to be a paranormal activity experience sharing site where users can create posts, comments and add an upvote or downvote based on whether they believed it or not. While there were some tough troughs of getting stuck on certain issues, every one of our problems except lack of time was solved. While my group may not realize it yet, I believe they will become excellent developers by the end of the course and I have full faith that their self-doubt is unfounded.

While we didn't complete the goals assigned to us, we found ways to solidify our understanding of our program even if we don't yet believe we have. I'm excited to resume our learning during the next week, with some well needed rest after learning and applying so much. I had a great time working as a cohesive group, and I discovered I have oodles of procedure, communication techniques and Scrum practices to learn. I'm extremely motivated to move forward with BoiseCodeWorks and I'm ecstatic to find out what explainable magic we learn next.
