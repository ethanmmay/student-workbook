## Day 3

### MySQL and Database connections

#### 1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

```Enum is like a JavaScript Array and they're used for maintaining indices.```

#### 2. How can you modify an Enum?

```You shouldn't modify them unless you create an entirely new one.```

#### 3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

```Enums could be used as a constant reference variable for the values of rock paper and scissors and could be referred to after generating a random number and then using it as an index to define what choice that will be.```
