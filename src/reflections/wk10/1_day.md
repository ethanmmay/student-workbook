### Learning C# and .NET 5.0

#### 1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

```Long-term, short-term and meta data are three types of data that allow us to store data indefinitely, temporarily and keep information about that data that aides in managing it.```

#### 2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

```Value-type data types are data types that store their own data within memory allocation. Booleans, all number data types, char and date are Value-type data types. In Javascript this list is a lot smaller as there is less emphasis on data types and their usefulness.```

#### 3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

```Reference types get stored in memory through a collection of value types that are found with a reference. So reference type data only stores a reference to a location with more data.```
