### Baby Steps

#### 1. What is a Github action and how do they work?

```GitHub Actions are tasks you can tell git to perform after certain events. They run self-created code or provided code to re-organize or activate transformations and increase automation.```

#### 2. What benefits do Github actions provide?

```Increased productivity, reduced menial tasks & just another feature to help increase workflow.```

#### 3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?

```The trigger actions for GitHub Actions are events. This could be a pull request with an Action that verifies a third party authentication service or a merge commit that uses an alternate merging service.```
