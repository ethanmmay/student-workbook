## Day 1

### Front End Re-Design

Starting another week remotely, I decided it was time to overhaul the front-page's design. I brainstormed some cool ideas for the buttons, layout, color scheme, backgroind image and mobile layout. While presenting to my teammates, I gathered even more ideas about what would fit the purpose of our site, as well as what would make an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive GUI. While I didn't get anywhere near I wanted to be in terms of styling by 5, I did put in some extra time afterwards to make the front page look visually appealing. I added a carousel, panel buttons, a offset background image with minimalistic and artistic qualities.

#### 1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

```Vanilla JS, Vue.js, Node.js, Figma, MongoDB and Auth0 are the technologies we used to create our project. As for principles, we used paper prototyping. We also used observer pattern in components and Sockets. MVC, OOP, SOLID, CRUD, RESTful, are just a few acronym principles we used.```

#### 2. What went well so far?

```With our light amount of Scrum management due to our small team size and small time-frame, we have been consistently communicating to work around each other and prevent merge conflicts. This communication has worked well, however, delegating work to people through back-end, front-end and rover was not very efficient as this was a learning project and it prevented some of us from learning certain parts of the project we need to know.```

#### 3. What would you do differently? Why?

```I would use the scrum technique of a project backlog with available tasks, in progress tasks and completed tasks even with such a small team. It would just create a better idea for everyone on what to work on and to prevent stalling or miscommunication.```
