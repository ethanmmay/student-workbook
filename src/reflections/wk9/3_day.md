## Day 3

### The Functionality Pyramid

#### 1. How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

```Scrum with a small team is more interpersonal and about understanding what others are working on, and communicating through speech and contact to work around each other and maximize productivity. Scrum with a large team divides work in a much less personal way. A board of tasks, a sprint backlog. There is still effective communication between developers, but the workflow is much more organized and less human.```

#### 2. Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

```Because multitasking is a human myth and work while focused on multiple concepts and tasks is prone to cluttering the mind and decreasing productivity tenfold.```

#### 3. What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

```The unattainable triangle is a reminder that it's countereffective to pursue excellence in all three quantitative measurements of progress - quality, time and cost. Scrum determines that constraints should be added to the expectations for quality, time and cost. This is to prevent overspending, crunch and a low quality result.```
