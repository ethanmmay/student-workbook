## Day 3

### Integrating APIs & Data

Starting the day off with a function that logs all factors of a number, we dived into how to have multiple APIs and how to transfer data between them and the complications of ids and models. Our dnd spellbook application we created as a class helped me to see the possibilities for API combinations and the entrepreneurial possibilities with them. For example, if you created translation programs that could bend data to fit both APIs, you could connect the APIs and increase your control over the data, as well as increase the possibilities for creating something that nobody has before.

1. Async and await specify that the function is asynchronous to an API and therefore will wait the specified timeout time until moving on.

2. Add async to specificy that the function is asynchronous.

3. They're much less complicated than .then and .catch. They link to out axios service as well..
