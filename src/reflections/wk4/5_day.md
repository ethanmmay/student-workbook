## Day 5

### More Scrum & Checkpoint 3

With a two hour lecture on Scrum, I feel confident that scrum is a useful addition to my arsenal of knowledge and while other processes create useless plans and architecture that become obsolete at the first sign of struggle, Scrum is adapative to both the client and the dev team, and is a nudge towards speed, but still not rushed. Wrapping up week 4 I feel very confident in my ability to do everything taught so far, but I still know nothing about how real-life sites are actually hosted. I feel like I've been working on gingerbread houses to learn how to build a real house, without looking at a real house.

I know there is still so much I have to learn from the course, but it would be nice to see how the concepts we are learning are used in real enterprise sites. I feel confident starting checkpoint 3, I know I will encounter trouble when syncing data through multiple APIs but I'm confident I can pull it together.
