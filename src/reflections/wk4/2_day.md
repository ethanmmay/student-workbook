## Day 2

### Previous Site Improvements with APIs

After a difficult but satisfying morning challenge, we dived into improving our gregslist application using our newfound ability of API requests. While working on a communal API, we all posted, put, deleted, and got each others gregslist "listings". This project helped us to truly understand the malleability of data and how it can be used to create a network of users. I extended the API functionality to my gregslist program in all departments - Cars, Jobs and Houses. I feel that I have cemented the knowledge of how the api requests work and what kind of input and output they require.

1. Fulfilled, rejected or pending. 

2. A promise is like a scout between two leaders. He runs faster than the army, and can help communicate what truly needs to be done. A promise can alert your own program if your request will be rejected, and therefore spend less timeout time waiting for the data. 

3. .then if a statement that tells he program what to do if the API request is fulfilled. The .catch statement tells the program what to do if an API request is rejected. The program stalls if the promise is pending.
