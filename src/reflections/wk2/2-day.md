## Day 2

### More JavaScript Introduction

Once we adequately learned more about loops, arrays, objects and more during Lecture, we moved onto more JavaScript Challenges that were more advanced but still had only minor applications. 

1. The three ways to syntactically write a function are as a declared statement, an inline lambda arrow function and as an inline expression.

2. Parameters define the type of data inserted into a function, Arguments are the actual data passed into the function.

3. Higher order functions are basically the managers of functions, they call other functions to complete small tasks while the larger function manages the full task. Basically nested functions.
