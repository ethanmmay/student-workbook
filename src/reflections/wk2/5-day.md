## Day 5

### Review & Conference Call Introduction

Arriving after heavy traffic and a closed connector, we reviewed JavaScript Topics and learned about LinkedIn and the Software Development Employment Process.

I felt confident coming into the week with JavaScript, but then came into some slight turbulence when learning new ways of iterating through nested objects and understanding what separates default functions from the conventional update and draw functions. After this turbulence, though, I bounced back and reminded myself that there is still lots to learn about JavaScript. Moving into Week 3 I'm excited to learn brand new topics and discover what types of architectures and models Developers use to organize, build and complete their Projects.
