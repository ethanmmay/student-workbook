## Day 1

### Introduction to JavaScript: A Refresher

Following the completion and grading process of Checkpoint 1, we dived into JavaScript and learned about variables, conditionals, objects and switch statements. After our rough introduction, we moved onto small challenges on transforming different types of data, with the hardest challenges being the Switch statement challenges and the CamelCase challenge. Links to the testing site can be found at the bottom of this reflection.

#### 1. What is Scope?

```The Scope of variables is where they are available to be accessed in the file. For example, variables defined in a for loop are not available outside of that loop unless instantiated before the loop. This is because the scope of that variable is inside the loop, not in the main file.```

#### 2. What is Hoisting?

```Hoisting is a feature of JavaScript where the program instantiates all variables in the file, and then turns later assignments into re-assignments of that variable. let defines variables without hoisting them, maintaining the scope of that variable.```

#### 3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

```Const is immutable. Var is older and slightly deprecated. let is newer and it is best practice to use let and const. let does not hoist the variable. This is beneficial because it allows Scope to be more specific.```
