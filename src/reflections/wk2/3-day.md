## Day 3

### DOM JavaScript Practice

With more practice in JavaScript we dived into DOM and accessing the HTML through JavaScript. During lecture, we learned how to build a web site that uses JavaScript to update the page without refreshing. During Lab, I built my afternoon project and added quality of life and styling features that helped achieve more practice with DOM and the integration between JavaScript and HTML/CSS. 

1. Console.log() is an extremely useful tool that helps keep track of variables, errors, function outputs and much, much more. You can also open the console with Chrome Dev Tools and call functions or manipulate variables to test their effectiveness in a more agile environment than Visual Studio Code.

2. The inspect element option on Chrome Dev Tools opens an inspector that shows an interactive version of your code where  you can hover and click on lines of code to see what they affect on the page.

3. The debugger keyword can help slow down the processes of the function to analyze it's effectiveness and learn where and what is going wrong.
