## Day 1

### JavaScript Classes & File Structure

After grading our "moonminer" project, we dived into Classes and contstructing objects. Throughout learning about the constructor method, custom object methods and how to call or return values from Objects in classes, I felt confident about my newfound knowledge of JavaScript Classes. During Lab we solidified that knowledge and gained an understanding of how classes and objects work.

1. Exporting classes allows portability for that model, possibily minimizing the operations and work required to set-up similar objects in the future. It also allows us to use file structure to organize our code, instead of using a handful of enourmous files for one large project.

2. Export default is the default function exported from a file to another, allowing for less specificity when importing. Named exports must be imported with said name, which can lead to the creation of "packages" being exported from one file to another, or in other words, a group of functions/objects.

3. The modular system is revered for all types of tools because it allows interchangability and quick, guided building for a project. In JavaScript, this is the act of separating functions of different uses into their own files and importing them into a main file when needed, to reduce clutter and allow multiple, different uses of said function.
