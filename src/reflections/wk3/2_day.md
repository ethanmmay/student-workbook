## Day 2

### Model, View, Controller, Service

After a tough morning challenge, we dived into the MVC architecture and learned how the basic structure works, how it uses encapsulation to increase security and useability. 

1. Encapsulation is used to increase security and control over what the user can see and do. However, this only helps against he average site user, not the console savvy users who can still find, edit and manipulate the data behind the page.

2. The underscore prefix within classes is to signify that a function has a global scope and is able to be called from whereever in in the project's imported files. For areas where a function's scope cannot be reached but is wanted to, closures can be used.

3. The private keyword when declaring a variable sets a limited scope on the function, so that it does not conflict with anything on the global or public scope.
