## Day 5

### Scrum cont. & Checkpoint 3

After wrapping up a week with all new content for me, I'm excited to continue learning more ways to structure files that help with organization, security and functionality. I feel confident in most of the subjects taught this week, however that doesn't mean I couldn't use a little bit of practice. I feel I'm currently having the most problems with the dynamic templates we use to change HTML through JavaScript. Making smooth UI is much more difficult when it's dynamic and can change so much. I'm excited for starting Asyncronous code next week, as I have always been curious about how APIs, widgets and the ease of implementation of enterprise data. After being told that this week (3) is one of the more difficult weeks, my concerns about work overload in the later weeks have been somewhat quelled. While attending both BSU and CodeWorks has been difficult, I feel much more confident that I won't break down when BSU Finals and long checkpoints at CodeWorks both require my attention.
