### C# Inheritance & Interfaces

#### 1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

```Modularity, Re-usable code and a defined system for controlling the scope of variables.```

#### 2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

```A class can inherit all the members of a class it chooses to.```

#### 3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

```If something can be inherited, it will be accessible. If it can't it won't be accessible.```
