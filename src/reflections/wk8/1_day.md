## Day 1

### Finishing Bug Log & Planning Capstones

After a weekend of tinkering and adding features, I finished up my Bug Log checkpoint by re-styling it to look like the Figma and making sure the features are smooth and include no jarring transitions. I double-checked to make sure I would meet all requirements and started thinking about Capstones and what type of project would look best in my portfolio as well as be the best to show off and learn new skills. I narrowed it down to a Kahoot clone, A writing prompt competition type game and a tinder re-creation but about something other than dating. Our group will most likely decide tommorow which app we want to create.

1. A developer portfolio provides an area that is much easier than GitHub to decipher which projects a developer is proud of and wants to show off. It allows employers and visitors to have easy acess to a developer's favorite projects.

2. A simple, organized developer portfolio makes it effective as it's not supposed to be another convaluted website to dig information out of like GitHub.

3. Since I am about to create my CapStone with 3 others, that is a project I will want to show off to employers and visitors because it is a culmination of my works with others.
