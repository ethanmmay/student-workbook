## Day 2

### Grading Bug Log & Starting Capstones

Meeting all 25 requirements, my bug log passed with flying colors and just as soon as I completed this project, we started a new, more complex project that requires teamwork, time management and the development of new skills such as Sockets, user relationships or HTML canvassing. We decided upon creating the project: Promptetition. Using what we've learned to create something specific but still targeted, we presented our project as a casual-competitive creative writing site that can do timed competitions, duels and for-fun writing. Our board liked the idea but suggested changing our main feature to be a daily challenge that users can respond to for practice or the win. Using a paper prototype and a figma template, our site design came as a first priority.

1. Communication on small teams is important because it keeps everyone busy and working on specific, but separate parts of the program as to minimize merge conflicts and maximize agility in development.

2. With such a small team, instead of allowing developers to select what they want to do from a sprint backlog board, we can indivually assign everyone with tasks during sprint stand-ups and sprint meetings. While this makes the items on our sprint backlog much larger and less evenly divided, it allows for faster communication and less Scrum preparation.

3. The unattainable triangle is a reference to Speed, Quality and Price in the development scene. A scrum team should try to find a balance between each of them to achieve a healthy development cycle. If you try to achieve all three fully, you will rush developers and lose quality.
