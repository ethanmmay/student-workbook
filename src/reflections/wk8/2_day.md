## Day 2

### Grading Bug Log & Starting Capstones

Meeting all 25 requirements, my bug log passed with flying colors and just as soon as I completed this project, we started a new, more complex project that requires teamwork, time management and the development of new skills such as Sockets, user relationships or HTML canvassing. We decided upon creating the project: Promptetition. Using what we've learned to create something specific but still targeted, we presented our project as a casual-competitive creative writing site that can do timed competitions, duels and for-fun writing. Our board liked the idea but suggested changing our main feature to be a daily challenge that users can respond to for practice or the win. Using a paper prototype and a figma template, our site design came as a first priority.
