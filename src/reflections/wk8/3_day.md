## Day 3

### Remote & Project Starting

After lots of deliberation, we decided on Prompetition yesterday and today we began filling out the basics and starting our journey towards our MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Because one of my family members tested positive for COVID, I went remote and ported over all of my development environment from my laptop to my home PC. After I had the bulk of the environment set-up complete, I got to work on building out the basic functionality of our Prompetition app. With a Scrum Daily Stand-up and consistent Scrum meetings, we maximized productivity while minimizing merge conflicts by delegating back-end to Jordan Wilker, rover to Nathan Quan, and front-end to myself.

1. Software development testing is used to create quantitative results for developed features. It is the use of API tests or QA Test Checklists to gauge where the project is at and what percentage of the Sprint Backlog is complete. 

2. The quantitative data from Development Testing gives Scrum masters and Product Owners clear visualizations of the product's wellbeing and progress. It also creates clarity for Developers about what they have done, and what they have yet to get done.

3. Testing takes time. Sometimes the developers have to take time out of their day to manage the tests instead of finishing the product. This could be considered a time-waste and will delay the product for test results that will be outdated very quickly.
