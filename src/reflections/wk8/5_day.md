## Day 5

### Approaching MVP

Today after roughing out the edges of backend and increasing communication for front-end to back-end connections, we got the daily Challenge displaying and changing based off of the day. We also got the ability to create likes working but more front-end responsiveness is required to truly wrap up this feature. So far with one week of Scrum-based Project work, I feel confident that the system works and is useful for encouraging conversation and clearly organizing what is complete and incomplete. I feel confident that during Week 2 we can wrap up our Minimum Viable Product, Add stretch goals and stylize the site to create an impressive user story for my skill level.
