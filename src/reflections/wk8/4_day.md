## Day 4

### More Prompetition Development

Continuing our development of Prompetition, we honed in on how exactly our webapp will work and how the business logic of votes, and the daily challenge. I also decided to start minor branding. I used a site called TailorBrands to create logos and icons for our App with the prompetition name on them. We did more small features and changes that optimized and fleshed out the app more. Nathan created an account page and Jordan figured out how to organize the backend for best ease of access.

1. There are apps created specifically for testing in Vue as well as a node package made specifically and officialy for Vue testing. There are short tests you can run and methods you can use to guarantee the function of your app.

2. I think that default QA User testing is the most efficient because it navigates the site as a human instead of a program and detects things that humans would detect, therefore providing evidence of how to improve user stories.

3. The testing method that is the least useful is the one that doesn't fit your program and how it uses it's Pages, Components, Models and Services. These will usually provide poor test results and should therefore be disregarded. Sticking to Vue conventions and finding the given way to do something in Vue is a large priority when it comes to forethought for testing.
