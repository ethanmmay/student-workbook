## Day 3

### Multiple Page Applications With Vue

Beginning with an Intermediate JavaScript Challenge we started learning more about Vue and how it uses hooks and the file structure pattern to create multi-page applications. We used Gregslist once again to practice Vue Routing and Components and how they are used to retrieve different sets of data or functions. Overall I feel more and more confident with Vue data binding and it's special configurations, but I still feel assured that I much more to learn before vue is in league with my vanilla JavaScript skills.

1. A program's lifecycle is it's process of compiling, building, serving and whatever else it must do in order to execute properly. There are listeners during this lifecycle process that trigger branches of a program. Frameworks create lifecycle hooks to listen to these processes and trigger a new branch when certain conditions are met.

2. The Observer Pattern, Constructors and Event Emitters are all forms of lifecycle hooks that our programs have been using. We have been using these since the beginning of the class.

3. Mounting hooks are the connections between classes, imports and exports that let data or function calls travel across the facets of the program.
