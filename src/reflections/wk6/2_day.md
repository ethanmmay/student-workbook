## Day 2

### More Vue

Starting the day off with the most difficult Morning Challenge yet, we started wire-framing a Vue site that displays search results for movies and allows you to inspect each movie for more details. Then during Lab we built a site that displays NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day. This small project really helped me understand Vue's data binding and specialized template attributes. During Fireside, we walked through how to integrate specialized, pre-built notifications on our sites.

1. Props are (if I understand correctly) constructors for each property casted to an Object. They define the type and the key of the property and leave the value up to the User's input or data's input.

2. Props are used for Type-Checking and Consistent Object Models. 

3. Props can be used or accessed in the script.
