## Day 1

### Introduction to Vue

Kicking off the week with our Sprint Planning Meeting, our class learned about Vue and how it's component based architechture can help us. We shared our Hackathon projects from last week and gloated at the senior class as they didn't present their Hackathon projects during their class. After organizing our Trello board during our Sprint Planning Meeting, we encountered a light primer about how Vue works, and how it helps application connections. After more in-depth coverage, I felt confident in my ability to keep learning Vue.

1. Component Based Architecture is the result of the Encapsulation pillar of Object-orientated Programming. It is a collection of small tools created with encapsulation and re-usability in mind to accelerate the process of development.

2. Component Based Architecture provides the benefit of referral. By using a collection of smaller tools to create a larger program, you can reuse class constructors, functions and variables to reduce computations and clutter. 
 
3. One drawback is it's littany of files that are included to create a Vue project. The file structure can sometimes become confusing with this expansive and ever-growing arsenal of small tools. Another drawback surfaces when this ever-increasing file complexity must be learned in it's entireity. Due to how many small files that do seperate things exist, it's difficult for a single developer to truly understand every line of code that goes into compiling the vue project.
