## Day 4

### Auth0 in Vue & Vue Review With You

Kicking off the day with creating a list of whiteboard challenges for us to slowly complete each thursday, we reviewed Vue and learned how to integrate Auth0 and it's verification capability. After setting up Auth0 we watched an app that utilizes the verification properties be created. Next, we must create another pokedex app using this new content.

1. A nested route is a child route of a full page made for smaller non-components or features of the page. This allows you to switch out components on each different route.

2. Using Gregslist as an example, you could create a route with listings, that has nested routes of listings/cars or listings/houses.

3. If you data bind id's to your route, you can. Otherwise you would need to add functionality for query parameters or other parameters.
