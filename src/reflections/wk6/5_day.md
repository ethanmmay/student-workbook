## Day 5

Kicking off a jam-packed day with the Senior Class presenting their largest projects, we put our skills to the test and started work on Checkpoint 5 which will be our most difficult yet, incorporating RESTful CRUD APIs into an all-inclusive Bloggr app that allows you to view other's blogs and create, edit and delete your own. This challenge was extremely useful for building new programming habits as well as deepening my understanding of Vue and it's Component-Router structure. 

Although this project was difficult, I feel it prepared me for truly understanding the entire stack and what each type of error means and how I might go about solving it. Faulty data in the shared API helped me understand why databases have such strict architecture and conventions, because it's terribly annoying when my iteration methods break due to null objects. I'm even more motivated to keep going along and learn new applications of these newfound skills as well as learn new skills that use my current skills as prerequisites.
